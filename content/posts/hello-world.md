## Hey there

üëãüèº Welcome to my blog.

Yes, I generated the image above using AI.
I burned through all of my free DALL¬∑E 2 credits for the month in the process.
I plan to do that for the majority of blogs.
However, no, I did not use ChatGPT or other AI to write any of this (_maybe I should have_).

Let's get into it.

## What are we doing here?

I started this blog for a few reasons.

- Its an outlet to write about my work.
  - Something
- Increase my writing skills.
- Keep a log of my work.
- Make another project.
- Share my work and knowledge.
- Get over imposter syndrome.

## What to expect

In my job role, I focus mostly on full-stack development and cloud architecture.
In my hobby projects, I still do that - but also explore anything I find interesting including playing with AI, programming Arduinos, increasing my Linux knowledge, game development, data visualization, and tinkering with whatever language or framework is currently trendy.
From this blog, expect content about all of the above plus whatever else hits my radar.

## Why build your own blog site?

I could have simply posted blogs on Medium or dev.to but where is the fun in that?
This blog is for the purpose of writing about my hobby projects.
The blog itself might as well be one of those projects - and here I am writing about it.

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
The theme is [my fork](https://github.com/nickbozentko/hugo-winston-theme-nick) of [Hugo Winston](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-winston-theme).

Hugo helped me build this quickly.
It's my first time playing with the framework.
The hardest part was choosing a theme and and resisting the urge to build my own from scratch (_maybe one day_).

## Are you still here?

If you made it this far, thank you!
I hope to post content here that is compelling and illuminating.
Stop by regularly to find new posts.
Upcoming, I'll set up a mailing list or RSS feed.
